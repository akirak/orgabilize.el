* orgabilize.el
Orgabilize (org + readable + ize) converts a web page into the Emacs Org mode format.
It uses [[https://gitlab.com/gardenappl/readability-cli][readability-cli]] as the backend.
It is an alternative to [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-web-tools][org-web-tools]] (which uses pandoc for conversion).
