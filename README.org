* orgabilize.el
Orgabilize (org + readable + -ize) is an Org-centric web page archiver and helper for Emacs.

It provides the following functionalities:

- Insert a link to a URL with its title.
- Insert the table of contents of a URL.
- Convert a web page to an Org file in an archive directory so you can read/quote/annotate it.
- View the source of a URL.

Upstream sources are stored (cached) locally, so operations are fast.

It uses [[https://gitlab.com/gardenappl/readability-cli][readability-cli]] to preprocess HTML.
It is an alternative to [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-web-tools][org-web-tools]] which uses pandoc, but =orgabilize= focuses on producing highly readable Org output from modern web pages.

On the other hand, *orgabilize is less reliable than org-web-tools*, because it basically assumes HTML markup is valid â€” It fails to process some web pages marked up invalidly.
It also cannot read the contents of client-rendered web pages, but it can still read titles and metadata from them.
See [[#limitations][Limitations]] for details.
** Installation
Install [[https://gitlab.com/gardenappl/readability-cli][readability-cli]].
** Configuration
** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2021-04-11 Sun 13:14]
:END:
*** Inserting a link
Use =orgabilize-insert-org-link= to insert a link into an Org buffer with its title.
*** Inserting a table of contents
Use =orgabilize-insert-org-toc= to insert the table of contents of a document into an Org buffer.
*** Archiving to a directory
Run =orgabilize-org-archive= to convert a web page to Org and save it to a file in =orgabilize-org-archive-directory=.
** Limitations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: limitations
:END:
At present, it fails to process many web pages.
This may improve in the future as tests are added and bugs are fixed, but it is not going to be perfect, because how this package works.

Another issue is the it cannot handle web pages that are supposed to be rendered in a browser (e.g. single-page applications).
For these pages, you can use =orgabilize-save-file-as-url= command to save an offline version as a URL.
A more thorough solution would be to integrate with a headless browser, but it is not going to be part of this package.
** Todo
- [ ] Improve the Org conversion
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Generate image links
  - [ ] Handle more invalid web pages
- [ ] Integrate with a headless browser to handle client-rendered web pages
